Task: connect with R1 to 2.2.2.2 network with rip time and then shut donw the fastethernet and connect it with static routing with serial cable

Why do we always use serial links between two routers, even though we have fast ethernet ports ?

***
 We mostly use serial links between multiples routers to propagate config data because these links support daisy chaining and can easily propagate commands over

and over without much configuration. Data over a serial link does not needs extensive addressing

neither does it carries a considerable overhead, a very good thing when we're trying to propagate config data over a large pool of routers/switches.

A part of it also has to do with the lineage: earlier routers had serial port linkages and to maintain compatibility, most new routers have serial ports too.

If we were to use Ethernet ports to propagate commands, we would be looking at tedious switching and routing, error checking mechanisms, considerable overhead and unnecessary broadcasts.

In modern routers, a serial port is often modified to look like a USB or an RJ-45 port, though it actually is a serial port

However, serial links to carry IP packets are fairly uncommon though you may find one if you're using a T1/ISDN line, or between old DCE-DTE links.. 

Serial ports also support TDM (Time-division multiplexing) which makes it possible to daisy chain 

WAN links to distribute incoming bandwidth between various routers. Serial links are slow and are highly prone to transmission errors which is why we've switched to Fast/Gigabit Ethernet links nowadays.

Note: we will use c3725 model cuse c7200 not support the wic interfaces

NOTE: you can change the ip address , mac address , caples and make your own toplogy it's only for education Fell free when use it
